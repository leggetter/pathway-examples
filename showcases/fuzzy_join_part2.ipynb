        "Previously, we had a simple pipeline that matched entries of two different tables, such as two logs of bank transfers, in two different formats.\n",
        "Many matchings can be inferred automatically, but some can be really tricky without help: while the fans of Harry Potter can instantaneously make the connection between 'You-Know-Who' and 'Voldemort', it is impossible for a computer to do so, at least without help.\n",
